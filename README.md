Twezzy Social Network


In this initial creation of our social network, Fernando and Quy split up tasks between themselves,
where Fernando worked on the feed page, profile page, and the logo of the website. The name Twezzy is similar to
twitters social network, where Twezzy has the logo and mascot of a dodo bird. In terms of the culture of the website, the entire network
is referred to as a "waddle," since a group of dodo birds is referred to as a waddle, which the team thought would fit well with the theme
of dodo birds and groups communicating together on this network. Quy worked mainly on
the sign in page along with the main home page. Quy also worked on the main stylings in the style.css file, where the team chose
to create a modernistic look to our website, similar to that of twitter and facebook. The blue and green tones offer a cool feeling to the website,
where it feels welcoming and not aggressive towards the users vision, along with the soft edges and fonts used to offer a
simplisitc and neat tone to the entire page. Both Fernando and Quy worked on the sign up page,
and throughout the process the entire team discussed some features that can be added to make the sign up page responsive and neat. This
included making a 3 step sign up process that is visually appealing to look at and also functions well for a user to sign up on the social
network. In terms of what technologies the team used, for right now the website is simply using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.
The site is using the cloud based bootstrap stylings and functions that are included in each html file. As of
right now, the social network website is implemented with github pages but implementation will most likely
move to a different form factor. To go into more detail on the pages that are currently in the social network, the sign up page is just a page
for users to sign up, where they offer optional and required information to make an account. The sign in page allows existing users to sign into the 
social network with their username/email and of course their password. The profile page offers the user their own profile information including posts
that they have made. The feed page includes posts that are relevant to the user that is signed in, so for example they could see posts from people that they are
following. Each post also has buttons for users to comment, like, and dislike, offering interactivity with each post.
The home page simply has a page for a user to sign in. In each page however, there is a navigation bar with the logo and title that can navigate to each page
that is available on the network.
